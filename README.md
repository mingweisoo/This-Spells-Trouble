## Introduction
*This Spells Trouble!* is a is a 2D battle arena local multiplayer game where two to four players battle each other for five rounds and gain points if they are the last person standing in the arena. Unlike most MoBAs, players fight in a free-for-all mode on a shrinking platform surrounded by lava, aiming and casting spells in order to push each other off the platform and eliminate one another. After each round, players get to purchase, upgrade or sell spells in the spell selection menu, allowing them to mix and match their deadly arsenal as each round passes. As such, players are able to create combinations of spells that work well in tandem, creating their own playstyle which is different from others. At the end of all five rounds, the player with the most points wins.

## System Requirements
* Windows
* Only supports controller input (at the moment)

## Inspirations
The mechanics of the game were mainly inspired by a map made for Warcraft 3, Warlock, which has been remade for both DotA2 and Warcraft 3 Reforged. The criteria for defeating players came from that of Nintendoâ€™s Super Smash Brothers series. Player controls are loosely based on the controls in the popular MoBA mobile game, Brawl Stars.
